title: Assertion message trick 
---

Here is a simple trick to print a message when an assertion is violated. Assuming you have the following assertion:

```c++
assert(foo != nullptr);
```

You then just append the message you want to print to the check with a logical conjunction like this: 

```c++
assert(foo != nullptr && "Usually due to not calling bar()");
```

Now, when this assertion fails the following message is printed:

```
Assertion `foo != nullptr && "Usually due to not calling bar()"' failed.
```
