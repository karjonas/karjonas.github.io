I was watching one of Bisqwit's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpLoS7B6T94) and saw a line of code in a for loop I have never seen before. It looked something like this:

{% highlight python %}
import urllib2
[...]
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight C++ %}
for(unsigned n: { 0xF999F,0x26227,0xF1F8F,0xF1244,
                  0xF9F9F,0xF9F1F,0xF9F99,0xF8F88 })
{% endhighlight %}

I wondered what type the list would be. So I tried to compile this with clang and get the ast dumped but got the following error:

``` C++
file.cpp:5:19: error: cannot deduce type of initializer 
list because std::initializer_list was
 not found; include <initializer_list>
```

Aha, so we know this is an ```initializer_list```. I include ```<initializer_list>``` and it compiles.
