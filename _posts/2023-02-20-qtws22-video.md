This is a video link to the presentation called "Taking 3D Content to the Next Level with Physics, Global Illumination, Reflections and Spatial Audio" at Qt World Summit 22, that I was a part of. In my segment I present the Qt Quick 3D Physics module introduced in Qt 6.4. A new high-level API for physics simulation with support for simulating static and dynamic rigid bodies, collision shapes, and a character controller.
