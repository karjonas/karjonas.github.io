Recently I needed a way of showing the difference between two programs rendering the same geometries. What I did was use a HTML-based image slider called [before-after.js](https://github.com/jotform/before-after.js), that allows you to slide between the two images. I think this is a simple and powerful way of showing the difference between the images. Click [here](/assets/before-after-js/sample.html) or the image below to try it out.
