title: IEEEVis 2019 Short paper published
---

Me and a few of my colleagues have published a paper for the IEEEVis 2019 conference.
The paper is about using Signed-distance functions for rendering neurons, which is a technique I developed for [Brayns](https://github.com/BlueBrain/Brayns).
The paper is titled "High Fidelity Visualization of Large Scale Digitally Reconstructed Brain Circuitry with Signed Distance Functions" and you can read it [here](/assets/vis19d-sub1191-i6.pdf).
